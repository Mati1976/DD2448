\begin{problem}
  \begin{subproblem}[\TP{1}]
    Let   $p_{0},...p_{l}\in [0,1]$.  
    We can define the next sum: \newline $S_{l}=\left|p_{1}-p_{0}\right|+\left|p_{2}-p_{1}\right|+\left|p_{3}-p_{2}\right|+...+\left|p_{l-1}-p_{l-2}\right|+\left|p_{l}-p_{l-1}\right|$ \newline
    We know that this sum must follow the triangle inequality :\newline
    $S_{l}\geq \left|p_{1}-p_{0}+p_{2}-p_{1}+p_{3}-p_{2}+...+p_{l-1}-p_{l-2}+p_{l}-p_{l-1}\right|=\left| p_{l}-p_{0}\right|$.\newline
    According to the definition we also know that $\left| p_{l}-p_{0}\right|\geq \triangle$.\newline
    If we take the assumption that all the terms that build up the sum $S_{l}$ are equal to each other and to  quantity which we will define to be $x$ we can say that $S_{l}=l\times x\geq \triangle$ and therfore we can say that $x\geq\triangle/l$ and of course that x represents each of the terms in the sum and we have proved what is needed.\newline 
    
    If the most common case, in which not all the components that build up $S_{l}$ are equal to each other than some of them , at least one, must be bigger than $x=S_{l}/l$ (which we have defined before) and hence there is

\begin{problem}
  \begin{subproblem}[\TP{2}]
    We know that by definition a function is negligible if it  smaller than the inverse of any polynomial function for a large enough n. If we multiply such a function by another polynom we will create a new polynom and by a definition the negligible function should be smaller than any such function ( possibly for a different n ) and hence the new function is also negligible .  % We leave this place holder here for improved readability.
  \end{subproblem}
  \begin{subproblem}[\TP{2}]
    If the function is not negligible then we know that  it is not smaller than any polynom we can present to it while addressing n goes to infinity . if after doing so we se multiply it by another polynom we create a new polynom .% We leave this place holder here for improved readability.
