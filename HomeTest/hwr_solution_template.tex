\begin{problem}
\begin{subproblem}[\TP{1}]
    Let $p_{0},...p_{l}\in [0,1]$. We can define the next sum:\newline $S_{l}=\left|p_{1}-p_{0}\right|+\left|p_{2}-p_{1}\right|+\left|p_{3}-p_{2}\right|+...+\left|p_{l-1}-p_{l-2}\right|+\left|p_{l}-p_{l-1}\right|$ \newline
    We know that this sum must follow the triangle inequality :\newline
    $S_{l}\geq \left|p_{1}-p_{0}+p_{2}-p_{1}+p_{3}-p_{2}+...+p_{l-1}-p_{l-2}+p_{l}-p_{l-1}\right|=\left| p_{l}-p_{0}\right|$.\newline
    According to the definition we also know that $\left| p_{l}-p_{0}\right|\geq \triangle$.\newline
    If we take the assumption that all the terms that build up the sum $S_{l}$ are equal to each other and to  quantity which we will define to be $x$ we can say that $S_{l}=l\times x\geq \triangle$ and therefore we can say that $x\geq\triangle/l$ and of course that x represents each of the terms in the sum and we have proved what is needed.\newline 
    
    If the most common case, in which not all the components that build up $S_{l}$ are equal to each other, then some of them, at least one, must be bigger than $x=S_{l}/l$ (which we have defined before as such.) and hence there is at least one of the components $\left|p_{i}-p_{i-1}\right|\geq\triangle/l$ .

    Let \textit {$Z_{n}^{(i)}=(X_{n,1},...,X_{n,i},Y_{n,i+1},...,Y_{n,l(n)})$}, So therefore : \newline
    \textit {$Z_{n}^{(0)}=(Y_{n,1},...,Y_{n,i+1},...,Y_{n,l(n)})$}, and 
    \textit {$Z_{n}^{(l(n))}=(X_{n,1},...,X_{n,i+1},...,X_{n,l(n)})$}.\newline
    The above terms were calculated based on the case that when $i=0$ the coefficients of \textit{$X_{n,i}$} will be \textit{$X_{n,0}$} and hence $i=0<1$ so none of the \textit{$X_{n,i}$} terms will be included in \textit{$Z_{n}^{(0)}$}and the \textit{$Y_{n,i}$} terms will be starting from \textit{$Y_{n,0}$} and finishing at the last term \textit{$Y_{n,l(n)}$}. The same argument can be written for the case of \textit{$Z_{n}^{(l(n))}$} with the exchange of the rolls between \textit{$X_{n,i}$} and \textit{$Y_{n,i}$}.\newline 
    We know that \textit{$D:\{0,1\}^*\rightarrow \{0,1\}$} is an algorithm that samples and outputs a single bit and that \textit{$X_{n}$} and \textit{$Y_{n}$} are independently and identically distributed, and efficiently sampleable and hence we can deduvt that :\newline 
    Pr\textit{$[D(Z_{n}^{(0)})=1]$} = Pr\textit{$[D(Y_{n})=1]$} and also : \newline 
    Pr\textit{$[D(Z_{n}^{(l(n))})=1]$} = Pr\textit{$[D(X_{n})=1]$} .\newline

  \begin{subproblem}[\TP{2}]
    We know that by definition a positive function $\triangle(n) $ is called negligible,if for any positive polynomial \textit{$p(n)$} there exists a constant \textit{$n_0$} such that  for all \textit{$n \geq n_0$} we have $\triangle(n) \leq 1/p(n)$. \newline 
    The definition above defines a class of function that is decreasing faster than any polynomial at the limit that $n \rightarrow \infty $. \newline 
    Let us define a new polynomial $q(n)=l(n)/{p(n)}$ . We know that If the rank of $l(n)$ is lower than $p(n)$  \[\lim_{n \to +\infty} q(n)=1/r(n)\] when $r(n)$ is a polynomial whose rank is the ratio between the highest ranks of $P(n)$ and $l(n)$. We are returning to same problem from before $\triangle(n)\leq 1/r(n)$. As $\triangle(n)$ is negligible it should be decreasing faster than any polynomial , hence the previous condition must be filled. After we have established the fact that $\triangle(n)\leq l(n)/p(n)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty $ we can divide both sides by $l(n)$ and prove the fact that if $l(n) $ is negligible also $\triangle(n)/{l(n)}$ is negligible. \newline 
    If the rank of $l(n)$ is higher than $p(n)$ the problem turns out to be proving that $\triangle(n)\leq r(n)$ when this time $r(n)$ is the ratio between l(n) and p(n) highest ranks . As this polynomial is growing as we approach infinity our function $\triangle(n)$ is obviously decreasing faster than an increasing function and hence the proof is complete .

  \begin{subproblem}[\TP{2}]
    We know that by definition a positive function $\triangle(n) $ is called not negligible,if for some positive polynomial \textit{$p(n)$} there exists a constant \textit{$n_0$} such that  for all \textit{$n \geq n_0$} we have $\triangle(n) > 1/p(n)$. This means that in this case we need to find only one positive polynomial, \textit{$p(n)$}, which will be decreasing slower than our function $\triangle(n) $ as $n \rightarrow \infty $, in order to say that it is not negligible.  \newline 
    According to the question we know that for some \textit{$p(n)$}, $\triangle(n) > 1/p(n)$  as $n>n_0$ .
    . It is asked to prove that we can find some  \textit{$p(n)$} such that $\triangle(n)/{l(n)} > 1/p(n)$ will hold, as $\triangle(n)$ as $n>n_0$ . By multiplying both sides of the equation by \textit{$l(n)$} we have to prove that for some \textit{$p(n)$}, $\triangle(n) > l(n)/p(n)$  as $n>n_0$ .\newline
    Let us define a new polynomial $p^*(n)={p(n)*l(n)}$ and replace $p(n)$ by ${p(n)^*}$ ( we are allowed to choose which ever function we want in order to prove our claim.). So now we need to prove that  $\triangle(n) > \frac{l(n)}{p(n)*l(n)}$  as $n>n_0$ , but after cancelling the $l(n)$ term from the RHS of the previous inequality we need to prove that \textit{$p(n)$}, $\triangle(n) > {1}/{p(n)}$  as $n>n_0$  which was the data given to us and hence the proof is concluded .% We leave this place holder here for improved readability.

    As an advisor to the organization, I would advise them never to use a common modulus when providing the authorised personal the $(N,e)$ public keys. It seems to be a way to "keep things simple" by using only one modulus to all employees and we should be protected by the fact that no employee have the decryption key, $d$,for the other employees and hence he could not break down the cipher text of any of the other employees but this is not true and a use of a common modulus could add risks to our system.    % We leave this place holder here for improved readability.

    The fact that the decryption time of a popular online service is $1/100$ faster than the encryption time, we can learn that the key used for the decryption is way shorter than the one used for the encryption and this posseses a lot of risk to the system. A lot of times people use a shorter key to the encryption scheme as it is not a secret key and it is not needed to keep the secrecy of the key which could make the computation time (due to smaller exponents needed to be calculated ) for the encryption much shorter. On the decryption side it is well advised to use a long decryption key in order to protect from certain attacks.     % We leave this place holder here for improved readability.
